# tmbc_quotes

Adds a random quote to a wait screen when a form is submitted. We use this together with a wait spinner.

QA
Q: Why?
A: I thought it would be nice to give people to something else to look and read than just basic wait spinner and something like "Processing..."
Q: Why only one quote at a time?
A: I was thinking on adding a rotator to change the quote every couple seconds, but then decided not to, after all, this is still just a wait screen that may be shown only a fraction of a second. Feel free to pimp it if you want to.
Q: Why so plain design?
A: I like simplicity and (plain and) clean layout works best on small screens. Nothing is stopping you from making it as fancy looking as you want
Q: Will you add A and B?
A: Probably not. Only thing I may add is a link to more information about each author, but not sure whether it would be smart on a wait screen
Q: I tried it, it dowsn't work
A: Tough luck, this isn't intended for production as is, use the code snippets and integrate on your own implementation
